# Before `make install' is performed this script should be runnable with
# `make test'. After `make install' it should work as `perl test.pl'

######################### We start with some black magic to print on failure.

# Change 1..1 below to 1..last_test_to_print .
# (It may become useful if the test is moved to ./t subdirectory.)

BEGIN { $| = 1; print "1..2\n"; }
END {print "not ok 1\n" unless $loaded;}
use Astro::SunTime;
$loaded = 1;
print "ok 1\n";

######################### End of black magic.

# Insert your test code below (better if it prints "ok 13"
# (correspondingly "not ok 13") depending on the success of chunk 13
# of the test code):

( sun_time(
        type => 'rise',
        latitude => 40,
        longitude => -77,
        TZ => 'US/Central',
        date => "7 Aug 2000",
	) ne '5:13' ) && print 'not ';
print "ok 2\n";
